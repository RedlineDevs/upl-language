# UPL Language Support

This extension adds language support for the Useless Programming Language (UPL) to Visual Studio Code.

  * Built-in functions (`print`, `add`, `multiply`, `save`)
  * Comments (single-line `//`)
  * Strings (with escape sequences)
  * Numbers and boolean values
* Auto-closing pairs for brackets and quotes
* Code folding
* Basic language configuration
